Basics
======

You will want to follow along with these examples.
If something doesn't work, or confuses you, ask!

.. doctest::

    >>> count = 5.0
    >>> print 'count', count
    count 5.0

It's a bit annoying have to type `print` all the time,
but the Interpreter can save us some work:
    
.. doctest::

    >>> count
    5.0
    >>> count = count + 3.0
    >>> count
    8.0
    >>> count + count
    16.0

Go ahead and try it now.
You can call your variable whatever you like.
