Hello World
===========

By law (okay, convention), the first thing you ever code should 
be a program that prints out the phrase `Hello, World!`. This 
used to be a fairly major project that would take hours:

.. code-block:: python 

    >>> print 'Hello, World!'
    Hello, World!

Things to note:

* The quotation mark is next to the enter key
* You have to be precise in how you type
* Give it a try now
