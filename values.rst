Values and Assignment
======================

You will want to follow along with these examples.
If something doesn't work, or confuses you, ask!

.. doctest::

    >>> 5
    5
    >>> 5.0
    5.0
    >>> -5
    -5
    
Now we'll create a `name` (a `variable`) that points to a number:

.. doctest::

    >>> count = 5.0
    >>> count
    5.0
    >>> count + 3
    8.0

We can use the `variable` just as we would a number.

Exercise
--------

* Assign a number to a variable (call it whatever you like)
* Print the results of adding/subtracting a few numbers to/from it
