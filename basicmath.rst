Numbers are the most `fundamental` thing in a computer, everything 
else (text, graphics, sound) gets translated into numbers so that the 
computer can deal with them. So we need to understand what we can 
do with numbers.

.. doctest::

    >>> 5.0
    5.0
    >>> 5 + 3
    8
    >>> 5 * 3
    15
    >>> 5 / 2
    2
    >>> 5 / 2.0
    2.5
    >>> 5 / 3.0
    1.6666666666666667

Anything surprising happening in there?
