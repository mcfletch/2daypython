Sandwich Bot
============

Our first challenge is to get the sandwich bot to make a sandwich.
This is the most important thing any robot can be taught to accomplish.

Rules
-----

* you need to program the robot to make sandwiches

* only one programmer, everyone else advises them, but the person at the "keyboard" issues the commands

* you can't "show" the robot how to do things, you have to program it with words

* the robot has various safety protocols so he won't go crazy and butter everyone

* you need to figure out the rest
