Reviewing the Sandwich Bot
==========================

* How smart is a robot/computer?

* How fussy is the robot about instructions?

* Did we have to break down the task into smaller steps?

* Did we create any "loops" where the robot did something many times?

* Did we do things "until" or "while" something was true or false?

* Did we create any "tests" (if this is true, do that, otherwise do that)?

* Did we assign names to sequences of actions "butter the bread", "take the bread out of the bag"?

* Did we make our named sequences handle different things "do the same thing for the jam"
