Variables
=========

Variables are `names` that point to values (`objects`).
Remember how a big part of programming is giving names to things?

.. doctest::

    >>> dogs = 1
    >>> cats = 2
    >>> dogs = cats
    >>> dogs
    2
    >>> dogs = 3
    >>> dogs
    3
    >>> cats
    2
    >>> cats + dogs
    5
