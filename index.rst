Software Carpentry Workshop (Python)
====================================

.. topic:: Learning to Program

    * You need to accomplish a task.
    * You decide to do it with a computer.
    * Now you have two tasks.

Why Python?
-----------

* Relatively straightforward to learn and use
* Free and open source
* Useful in many domains

  * System tasks
  * Web and database programming
  * Bioinformatics (BioPython)
  * Data analysis and visualization

* Large global community

System Setup
------------

* You will need a `Python <http://www.python.org/download>`_ interpreter 
  (Python 2.7 for the current version of these tutorials)
  
  * Academic users may wish to use the `Enthought Python Distribution <http://www.enthought.com/products/getepd.php>`_
    but we do not use any special features of this distribution in this lesson 

* You will need a copy of this `project distribution <download.tar.gz>`_ 
  (the exercises and sample data files are included in the archive)
  
  * save and extract the ``download.tar.gz`` file into a new directory
  
    * ``mkdir python-lesson``
    * ``wget http://142.1.253.67/download.tar.gz``
    * ``tar -zxvf download.tar.gz``

  * the ``workshop`` directory contains a local copy of this site
  * the ``exercises`` directory contains the exercise and source-code samples 
    you will need to complete the session
  
* You will need a ``bash`` or similar shell

  * On windows you may wish to install the `Cygwin <http://cygwin.com/install.html>`_
    environment to obtain a copy of bash (and potentially Python)
  * On Linux or Mac OSX you should already have bash available
