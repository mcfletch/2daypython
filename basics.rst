Basics (Values and Assignment)
==============================

You will want to follow along with these examples.
If something doesn't work, or confuses you, ask!

.. doctest::

    >>> 5.0
    5.0
    >>> count = 5.0 # Huh, nothing was printed?
    >>> print count
    5.0

It's a bit annoying have to type `print` all the time,
but the Interpreter can save us some work:
    
.. doctest::

    >>> count
    5.0
    >>> count = count + 3.0
    >>> count
    8.0
    >>> count + count
    16.0

Exercise
--------

* Assign a number to a variable (call it whatever you like)
* Display the value with print 
* Modify the value the variable holds
