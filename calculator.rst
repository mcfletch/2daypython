Building a Calculator
=====================

Let's build our first program.
We'll create a calculator that asks the user for two numbers 
and prints out the result of multiplying them.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python exercises/calculator.py 
    First Number? 23
    Second Number? 23
    Result: 529.0

Let's break down the steps:

* we need to get the first input from the user
* we need to store that input from the user
* we need to get the second input from the user
* we need to store that input from the user
* we need to convert the `string` inputs into `float` numbers
* we need to print out the result of the multiplication
