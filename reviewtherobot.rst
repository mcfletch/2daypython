Reviewing the Sandwich Bot
==========================

* How smart is a robot/computer?

* How fussy is the robot about instructions?

* Did we have to break down the task into smaller steps?

* Did we create any "loops" where the robot did something many times?

* Did we do things "until" or "while" something was true or false?

* Did we create any "tests" (if this is true, do that, otherwise do that)?

* Did we assign names to sequences of actions "butter the bread", "take the bread out of the bag"?

"Real" Programming
------------------

* That robot is *really* smart compared to real computers

* But otherwise, that's programming

* We break down problems into smaller steps until we find steps the computer can already do

* We describe how to solve the problem as a series of small steps

* We tell the computer to make decisions based on whether something is true or false

* We tell the computer to "iterate" (repeat) many times until something is true or false

* We assign names to the sequence of actions we have coded that tell (other) programers what the sequence does

* We can then use that (named) sequence of actions in higher-level programs
