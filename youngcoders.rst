Welcome to Coder's Club
=======================

Coding is a wonderful type of magic. You type text, the same kind of thing
that you would type into a word processor, and the computer can do almost 
anything as a result. It lets you change the world just by hitting keys 
on a keyboard.

But first we need to learn how to make the magic work. We need to get to 
a `console` (a program where we can directly type commands into the computer),
and from there we are going to start an `interactive interpreter` which will 
allow us to write code and have it immediately run.

Starting Python
---------------

* Get logged into your TDSB account

  * The same account you use for school

* Start Python

  * |startbutton| Start Button | type "py" | Choose "Idle" or "Pyscripter 2.7" or "Python"

  * If you don't see Python, choose another machine but *log out* first

The (Python) Interpreter (REPL)
-------------------------------

If you've started `Idle` or `Pyscripter` you are running an 
`Integrated Development Environment` which includes a Python Interpreter window.
You'll recognize it because it has a `prompt` that has 3 `greater than` symbols::

    >>> 

.. note::
    In the interpreter, the ``>>>`` prompt tells you that you can enter Python 
    code and have it executed when you hit ``<Enter>``.

If you've just started `Python` you will just see a black window with the prompt:

.. code-block:: bash 

    $ python
    Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:56) 
    [GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 


Don't worry if the numbers are slightly different, or there are different descriptions
of the program. What we care about is that you are seeing the `>>>` prompt and that the 
version of Python is 2.6 or 2.7.  If your version starts with 3, such as 3.2 or 3.4, 
then you'll need to deal with some minor changes throughout the course.
        
You can exit the interpreter by hitting your platform's ``<end of input>`` 
key combination.  On Windows this is ``<ctrl-z><enter>``.
