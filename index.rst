Welcome to Coder's Club
========================

Coding is a wonderful type of magic. You type text, the same kind of thing
that you would type into a word processor, and the computer can do almost 
anything as a result. It lets you change the world just by hitting keys 
on a keyboard.

.. topic:: While you wait, Find Python!

    * Get logged into your TDSB account

      * The same account you use for school

      * See Daniel or Betty-Lynn **immediately** if you need a password reset or don't have an account

    * Start Python
    
      * |startbutton| Start Button | type "py" | Choose "Idle" or "Pyscripter 2.7" or "Python"

      * If you don't see Python, choose another machine but *log out* first

    * Now ignore those computers! We have sandwiches to build after we say "Hi!"
