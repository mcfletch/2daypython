Hello World
===========

By law (okay, convention), the first thing you ever code should 
be a program that prints out the phrase `Hello, World!`. This 
used to be a fairly major project that would take hours:

Exercise
--------

.. code-block:: python 

    >>> print('Hello, World!')
    Hello, World!

.. note::

    * The quotation mark is next to the enter key
    * You have to be precise in how you type
    * Give it a try now
    * If you are using `Python 2.x` you should type:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print 'Hello, World!'
    Hello, World!
