Heart Click ++
==============

You are going to make **1** small change to your :doc:`heartclick` game.

Your Idea
----------

What do you want to change about the game? Make it something small and 
simple, something you can describe in a couple of words:

* "the heart runs away from the mouse"
* "show the number of clicks so far"
* "lose if they click more than 10 times"
* "get faster the longer they play"
* "2 hearts, one loses, the other wins"

Your Plan
----------

How do you think you can make the change?
