Comparisons
===========

Remember how we often need to create `tests` that let a computer 
decide if it should take some action? Here are some simple tests 
that we can use with integers:

.. doctest::

    >>> 2 > 3
    False
    >>> 0 < 4
    True
    >>> 3 >= 3
    True
    >>> 4 <= 6
    True
    >>> 8 == 8
    True
    >>> 8 == 9
    False
    >>> 8 <> 8
    False
    >>> True == False
    False
    >>> 1 == 1.0
    True
