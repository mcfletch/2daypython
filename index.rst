Software Carpentry Workshop (Python)
====================================

* You need to accomplish a task.
* You decide to do it with a computer.
* Now you have two tasks.

Still to Cover

* How do you solve a problem?

  * How do you figure out what is available?
  * How do you determine if something is working?
  * How do you figure out why it isn't working?
  * Where is the documentation?
  * Where do you ask questions (and how)?
  * What are the common patterns you'll see time and again?

* loops

  * for i,x in enumerate(y) ?
  * nested loops
  
* lists

  * range
  * steps?
  * sort, reverse
  
* dictionaries

  * hashability and mutability
  * unique checking
  * tuples?
  
* string manipulations?

  * formatting?
  * addition, multiplication?
  
* scripts

  * executable flags?
  * #! lines
  * __name__ == "__main__"
  * exit code (hopefully covered in Bash lesson just before us)

* simple file IO

  * opening (named) files
  * file "slurping" and in-memory processing
  * file iteration (line-oriented processing)
  * stdout, stdin, stderr (hopefully covered in Bash lesson)
  * path-name composition (os.path.join, etc)

* modules

  * numpy? (doing real work)
  * sys, os, subprocess (often required for any real work)
  * glob, shutil (getting things done at the OS level)
  * csv (real DSV files)
  * requests (web client operations)

* testing/verification?

  * asserting your assumptions (prelude to TDD)
  * asserting pre/post conditions
  * throwing errors vs silent corrections
  * handling corner cases
