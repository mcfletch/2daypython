Still to Cover
==============

* How do you solve a problem?

  * How do you figure out what is available?
  * How do you determine if something is working?
  * How do you figure out why it isn't working?
  * Where is the documentation?
  * Where do you ask questions (and how)?
  * What are the common patterns you'll see time and again?
  
* path-name composition (os.path.join, etc)

* modules

  * sys, os, subprocess (often required for any real work)
  * glob, shutil (getting things done at the OS level)
  * requests (web client operations)

* testing/verification?

  * asserting your assumptions (prelude to TDD)
  * asserting pre/post conditions
  * throwing errors vs silent corrections
  * handling corner cases
