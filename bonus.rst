Code Reuse
-----------

* using existing libraries can both save work and errors

  * for instance, the following will handle ``,`` characters encoded in your CSV files

    .. literalinclude:: exercises/reusecsv.py
        :language: python

  * existing libraries will also generally have functions you don't want to have to code yourself

    .. literalinclude:: exercises/reusenumpy.py
        :language: python
