Real Programming
================

That robot is *really* smart compared to real computers:
  
* Most programmers use a keyboard to code

* Real computers need you to be *really* fussy

* Real programs tend to get large and complex and require a lot of organization

But otherwise, that's the core of programming:

* We break down problems into smaller steps until we find steps the computer can already do

* We describe how to solve the problem as a series of small steps

* We tell the computer to make decisions based on whether something is true or false

* We tell the computer to "iterate" (repeat) many times until something is true or false

* We assign names to the sequence of actions we have coded that tell (other) programers what the sequence does

* We can then use that (named) sequence of actions in higher-level programs

* We "parameterize" the sequence of actions to handle more situations

So the first thing we need to do is to figure out what the computer can already do.
And that's how we start programming.
